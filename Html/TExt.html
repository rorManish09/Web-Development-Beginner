<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p >

    Molly had beeen starting out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature</em>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientist journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, an the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she neeeded to be free.
</p>
<p>
    She had spent the last tenn years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q> Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Althouth many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="DEoxyribonuclie acid "> DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievemant, Molly <em>did</em>think she had something better to do.
